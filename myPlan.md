Alright, let’s dive into the logic for your time tracking application! I’ll explain how it works, how time is tracked, and how various events and alternative situations affect the recorded times. We’ll cover the states, transitions, time metrics, and edge cases to ensure everything is clear, accurate, and flexible for your needs.

## **Overview of How the Application Works**
The time tracking application monitors a user’s work session by managing different states and recording time based on what the user is doing. It tracks time in distinct categories—work, breaks, and inactivity—and logs every state change in a timeline. The goal is to provide a detailed breakdown of how time is spent while handling real-world scenarios like manual breaks, inactivity, or early clock-outs.

### **Key States**
The application operates in four main states:
1. **Working**: The user is actively working (clocked in and productive).
2. **On Break**: The user is on a break (either a normal break or an office work break).
3. **Inactive**: The user is idle (e.g., no keyboard/mouse activity for a set period).
4. **Clocked Out**: The user has ended their session.

Each state has specific rules for what time gets recorded and what doesn’t.

### **Time Categories Tracked**
The app records time in these categories:
- **Total Work Time**: Time spent actively working (excludes breaks and inactivity).
- **Total Break Time**: Time spent on breaks (can be split into normal break time and office work break time).
- **Total Inactivity Time**: Time spent idle (not working or on a break).
- **Session Time**: Total time from clock-in to clock-out (includes work, breaks, and inactivity).

## **How Time is Tracked in Each State**
Here’s how the application handles time tracking based on the user’s state:

- **Working**:
  - **What’s Recorded**: Time adds to **Total Work Time**.
  - **What’s Not Recorded**: No time is added to **Total Break Time** or **Total Inactivity Time**.
  - **Example**: If you’re working for 2 hours straight, that’s 2 hours in **Total Work Time**.

- **On Break**:
  - **What’s Recorded**: Time adds to **Total Break Time** (and specific break type, e.g., Total Normal Break Time).
  - **What’s Not Recorded**: No time is added to **Total Work Time** or **Total Inactivity Time**.
  - **Example**: A 15-minute normal break adds 15 minutes to **Total Break Time**.

- **Inactive**:
  - **What’s Recorded**: Time adds to **Total Inactivity Time**.
  - **What’s Not Recorded**: No time is added to **Total Work Time** or **Total Break Time**.
  - **Example**: 10 minutes of no activity adds 10 minutes to **Total Inactivity Time**.

- **Clocked Out**:
  - **What’s Recorded**: No time is recorded in any category—the session is over.
  - **Example**: After clocking out, all timers stop.

## **State Transitions and Time Tracking**
Let’s walk through how the application moves between states and how time is affected during these transitions.

### **1. Clocking In**
- **Action**: User clicks "Clock In."
- **Transition**: → **Working**
- **Time Tracking**:
  - Starts **Session Time** (total duration of the session).
  - Begins accumulating **Total Work Time**.
- **Timeline Entry**: "Clocked In at [timestamp]"

### **2. Starting a Break (Manually)**
- **Action**: User selects "Take a Break," chooses a type (normal or office work), and sets a duration.
- **Transition**: **Working** → **On Break**
- **Time Tracking**:
  - Pauses **Total Work Time**.
  - Starts accumulating **Total Break Time** (and specific break type time).
  - Begins a countdown for the break duration.
- **Timeline Entry**: "Started [break type] Break at [timestamp] for [duration]"

### **3. Ending a Break**
- **Action**: Break timer expires or user manually ends the break.
- **Transition**: **On Break** → **Working**
- **Time Tracking**:
  - Stops accumulating **Total Break Time**.
  - Resumes **Total Work Time**.
- **Timeline Entry**: "Ended [break type] Break at [timestamp]"

### **4. Inactivity Detection**
- **Action**: No activity (e.g., keyboard/mouse) for a set period (e.g., 5 minutes).
- **Transition**: **Working** → **Inactive**
- **Time Tracking**:
  - Pauses **Total Work Time**.
  - Starts accumulating **Total Inactivity Time**.
  - Shows a notification: "Are you still working?" with options:
    - "Continue Working"
    - "Take a Normal Break"
    - "Take an Office Work Break"
- **Timeline Entry**: "Inactivity Started at [timestamp]"

### **5. Responding to Inactivity Prompt**
Here’s how the user’s response affects time:

- **Option A: "Continue Working"**
  - **Transition**: **Inactive** → **Working**
  - **Time Tracking**:
    - Stops **Total Inactivity Time**.
    - Resumes **Total Work Time**.
  - **Timeline Entry**: "Resumed Working at [timestamp] after inactivity"

- **Option B: "Take a Normal Break" or "Take an Office Work Break"**
  - **Transition**: **Inactive** → **On Break**
  - **Time Tracking**:
    - Stops **Total Inactivity Time**.
    - Starts **Total Break Time** (and specific break type time).
    - Begins break timer countdown.
  - **Timeline Entry**: "Started [break type] Break at [timestamp] after inactivity"

- **Option C: User Ignores Prompt for a Long Time (e.g., 30 minutes)**
  - **Transition**: **Inactive** → **Clocked Out**
  - **Time Tracking**:
    - Stops all timers.
    - Records inactivity up to the clock-out time in **Total Inactivity Time**.
  - **Timeline Entry**: "Automatically Clocked Out at [timestamp] due to extended inactivity"

### **6. Clocking Out**
- **Action**: User clicks "Clock Out."
- **Transition**: Any state → **Clocked Out**
- **Time Tracking**:
  - Stops all timers (work, break, inactivity).
  - Records time in the current state up to the clock-out moment.
- **Timeline Entry**: "Clocked Out at [timestamp]"

## **Alternative Situations (Edge Cases)**
Now, let’s cover some alternative scenarios and how they affect time tracking.

### **Edge Case 1: Clocking Out While on a Break**
- **Scenario**: User is on a break and decides to clock out.
- **Logic**:
  - Break ends immediately.
  - **Total Break Time** is updated with the time spent on the break up to the clock-out.
  - No further time is recorded.
- **What’s Recorded**: Break time up to clock-out in **Total Break Time**.
- **What’s Not Recorded**: No additional work or inactivity time after clock-out.
- **Timeline Entries**:
  - "Ended [break type] Break at [timestamp] (due to clock-out)"
  - "Clocked Out at [timestamp]"

### **Edge Case 2: Inactivity During a Break**
- **Scenario**: User is on a break and steps away (becomes inactive).
- **Logic**:
  - Inactivity doesn’t change the state—it’s still **On Break**.
  - Time continues adding to **Total Break Time**.
- **What’s Recorded**: All time during the break in **Total Break Time**.
- **What’s Not Recorded**: No **Total Inactivity Time** (since it’s already a break).
- **Why**: Breaks are intentional, so inactivity during a break counts as break time.

### **Edge Case 3: Multiple Breaks in a Row**
- **Scenario**: User ends one break and starts another immediately.
- **Logic**:
  - Each break is recorded separately.
  - Time accumulates in **Total Break Time** and specific break type metrics.
- **What’s Recorded**: Time for each break in **Total Break Time**.
- **What’s Not Recorded**: No **Total Work Time** between breaks.
- **Timeline Entries**:
  - "Ended [break type] Break at [timestamp]"
  - "Started [new break type] Break at [timestamp]"

### **Edge Case 4: Ignoring Inactivity Prompt for a Long Time**
- **Scenario**: User is inactive and doesn’t respond to the prompt for 30 minutes.
- **Logic**:
  - Time accumulates in **Total Inactivity Time**.
  - After 30 minutes, the app auto-clocks out.
- **What’s Recorded**: Inactivity time up to clock-out in **Total Inactivity Time**.
- **What’s Not Recorded**: No work or break time after clock-out.
- **Timeline Entries**:
  - "Inactivity Started at [timestamp]"
  - "Automatically Clocked Out at [timestamp] due to extended inactivity"

### **Edge Case 5: Manual Break During Inactivity**
- **Scenario**: While inactive, the user manually starts a break.
- **Logic**:
  - Transitions from **Inactive** to **On Break**.
  - Stops **Total Inactivity Time**.
  - Starts **Total Break Time**.
- **What’s Recorded**: Inactivity time before the break, then break time after.
- **What’s Not Recorded**: No **Total Work Time** during this period.
- **Timeline Entries**:
  - "Inactivity Started at [timestamp]"
  - "Started [break type] Break at [timestamp]"

## **Time Metrics and Calculations**
Here’s how the app calculates the key metrics:
- **Total Work Time**: Sum of all time in **Working** state.
- **Total Break Time**: Sum of all time in **On Break** state (split by break type if needed).
- **Total Inactivity Time**: Sum of all time in **Inactive** state.
- **Session Time**: Total time from clock-in to clock-out (work + breaks + inactivity).

**Key Rule**: Only one timer runs at a time to avoid overlap. For example, when you’re on a break, work and inactivity timers are paused.

---

## **Timeline Logging**
The app logs every state change with timestamps:
- **Clock In**: "Clocked In at [timestamp]"
- **Start Break**: "Started [break type] Break at [timestamp] for [duration]"
- **End Break**: "Ended [break type] Break at [timestamp]"
- **Inactivity Start**: "Inactivity Started at [timestamp]"
- **Inactivity End**: "Resumed Working at [timestamp]" or "Started [break type] Break at [timestamp]"
- **Clock Out**: "Clocked Out at [timestamp]"

This log helps you see exactly what happened during the session.

---

## **Summary**
This logic tracks time accurately across work, breaks, and inactivity, while handling edge cases like clocking out during breaks or extended inactivity. It’s flexible (e.g., manual breaks or inactivity responses) and user-friendly (e.g., no immediate clock-out after short inactivity). Time is recorded only in the active state’s category, ensuring clear separation of metrics.
